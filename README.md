## dailydigest.sh
A script that provides a high-level overview of my day, including:
- meetings scheduled
- emails I actually need to care about
- my Jira tickets in progress
- Datadog signals
- database cluster resource ussage
- some good news for the day

## im_hungry.sh
A script that outsources the thinking involved in choosing a meal by:
- asking questions to guide you to a selection of available meals, or
- suggesting a random meal, or
- identifying nearby delivery options
based on the time of day.

Suggestions for expansion/improvement:
- add a touch of color! Make keys and values different colors, or colorize headings differently, etc.
- set up slack integration for dailydigest.sh
- change snack food types in im_hungry.sh to use sweet/salty/spicy/crunchy istead of hot/cold and light/filling
